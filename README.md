# Digital-Scholarly-Edition-Letter-of-J.D.-Salinger
This project presents a TEI-encoded digital edition of a typed letter from J.D. Salinger to playwright Garson Kanin, dated May 29, 1957. In the letter, Salinger firmly but respectfully declines a theatrical adaptation of his work, expressing his personal convictions about creative control and artistic integrity. Edited and annotated by Dimitrios Chrysovalantis Mouzakitis as part of a class assignment, this scholarly edition preserves the historical, textual, and cultural context of the correspondence.
